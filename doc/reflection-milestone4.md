# Milestone 4 Reflection: Safe Vancity Dashboard App

> Authors: Arlin Cherian, Victor Francis, Wanying Ye

## 1. What we have implemented

We have made most of the implementations that we outlined in our proposal. These implementations include:

1.  An interactive map of `Crime Density by Neighbourhood, Crime Type, and  Month`;

2.  An interactive bar chart of `Total Reported Cases by Neighbourhood and Crime Type`;

3.  An interactive bar chart of `Total Reported Cases per Crime Category by Weekday and neighbourhood`;

## 2. What we decided not to implement

We decided not to include the `date range` and `time range` filters in our dashboard because:

-   It allows for too much granularity that may not necessarily be important for a potential end-user of our dashboard, instead we implemented other less granular filters that we thought might be more relevant to a regular user like filtering by `month` since we are only including data from 2021.

-   Too many filters will lead to clumsiness of the dashboard which may dissuade a potential user.

-   We also decided not to include the Top 3 crimes table that was mentioned in the proposal because this information was evident from the bar chart that reported total cases as we have displayed this in descending order. Instead, we replaced this section with a bar plot that looks at total reported cases by crime category and weekday for each neighbourhood.

## 3. What we think our dashboard does well

Our current dashboard has included all the basic functionalities that we planned to have from Milestone 1, including the capabilities of:

-   Ability to show the crime densities in specific neighbourhoods, filterable by crime type and month of the year.

-   A crime category tab to ensure groupings of similar crimes in clusters.

-   Ability to show the different crime types and the corresponding total number of reported crime incidents, filterable by neighbourhood.

-   Ability to show the different crime categories and the corresponding total number of reported crime incidents, filterable by weekday.

## 4. What are the limitations

The limitations of our dashboard include:

-   Small dataset. The dataset used was for January to December 2021 as released by Vancouver Police Department. It could have been better if we also used crime datasets for preceding years.

-   We did not implement complete reproducibility. That is, for example, this dashboard will not get updated if Vancouver Police Department releases more recent crime data on their website.

## 5. What are potential improvements & additions

If we had more time in the future, we have a couple of potential additions in mind:

-   Add more granularities by implementing time and date filters when data for additional years are included. We would have to also redesign the dashboard so it doesn't look clumsy because of the new additions.

-   Implement complete reproducibility. This is most especially important for the underlying dataset so that the dashboard gets updated as soon as the Vancouver Police Department releases new crimes data.

-   Also, we would use a larger dataset, probably as much as 10 years of crime data instead of one year's data that we currently have.

## 6. Known Issue and Comments

-   The top left corner (`x`) symbol dissapears when the `about` button is clicked, the top left corner (x) disappears. This is a known bug to us; fixable in the next iteration of our dashboard.

## 7. Feedback:

We are appreciative all of the feedback we received from the TA and our peers. These feedback have empowered us to improve upon initial iterations of our dashboard.

Some of the very helpful feedback include the ability of the horizontal bar chart to highlight the crime type selected in the filter on the left. Another recommendation was better description of variables in our proposal document. Also, an explanatory section where a non-technical user can refer to as a go-to guide was suggested. We have happily implemented these feedback.

## 8. Fixed issues from Previous Milestones:

-   Our fix to TA's feedback of better description of variables can be seen here:\
