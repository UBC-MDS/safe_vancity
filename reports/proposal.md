# Motivation and Purpose

**Our role**: Data Science team at VanRealtor

**Target audience**: Real estate customers looking to buy properties in
Vancouver neighborhoods and Real estate agents at Realtor looking for
listings in safer neighborhoods to attract more clients.

Being the largest city in British Columbia, Vancouver is an attractive
city to call home for many. Reasons include its vast ethnic diversity,
natural landscape, coastal, foresty, job market and so on. Despite the
vibrant quality of this city, an important factor when deciding to live
in a specific city depends on the safety of its neighborhoods, along
with other factors such as access to essential services, cost of living
etc. Research evidence have shown that crime types have had significant
changes during COVID at neighborhood levels in Vancouver (Anderson and
Hodgkinson 2022). For example, assault cases, arson and robbery have
increased in Vancouver’s Downtown core, Strathcona and Mount Pleasant
areas. At VanRealtor, we wanted to offer our clients the decision to
choose their next neighborhood to move, rent or visit while being aware
of the crimes statistics of the city. This dashboard allows people to
search for crime related information by neighborhoods in Vancouver using
data from 2021. Users can filter data based on geological location,
monthly crime rates, crime types and ..(will update as we finalize)

# Data Description

# Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

Mary is a new to Vancouver, who is not very familiar with the
neighborhoods. She wants to settle down by renting a place in Vancouver,
and now she faces the problem of which neighborhoods to choose. One
important factor she takes into account is the crime incidents. She
wants to compare the safety of neighborhoods in the aspect of least
crime incidents. Moreover, since certain types of crimes (*e.g.*
homicide) are more serious and life-threatening than others, she is also
willing to know the types of crimes that occur most frequently in a
particular neighborhood. In case that she only wants to accommodate for
a short period, it would be helpful to know the specific crime
distribution during that time frame.

When Mary log on to the “Van Safe app”, she can see the summary
statistics (*e.g.* the total crime incidents, the top 3 common crime
types, etc.) in Vancouver in 2021. She can then select the neighborhood
that she wants to know more, and choose a specific range of time using
the slider, she will be able to see the distribution of crime types
within the time range she chooses. For instance, she sees that during
2021-06 to 2021-08, which will be the actual duration of her residence
in Vancouver, “offense again a person” takes place quite often in
Strathcona. Therefore, she decides to remove Strathcona from her
candidate list of neighborhoods.

The app also allows her to check the crime incidents in each
neighborhoods according to the crime type she chooses. When she does so,
she finds that although Kitsilano has an overall low number of crime
incidents, several homicides were recorded for this neighborhood in
2021. Thus, she might decide to look into other neighborhoods.
