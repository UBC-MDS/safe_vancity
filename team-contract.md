# Team Contract

DSCI 532, Master of Data Science 2021-22

- Creation date: Feb 15, 2022
- Members: Arlin Cherian, Victor Francis, Wanying Ye

## Expectations

- The time expected for group members to work on DSCI 524 individually will be a maximum of 6 hours per week unless all the team members agree to shorten/lengthen the time expected. If team members cannot complete their sections within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission deadline (Saturday 6pm) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
- Should a group member have an unexpected emergency arise during the week, they are responsible to notify their other group members in a timely fashion so that the work can be redistributed accordingly.
- All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.
Each group member is expected to make at least 1 commit to the project per week.
- Outside of Milestone 1, each group member will aim to have the majority of their portion of the work for that week completed by Friday before the deadline. This ensures that the Proof Reader has sufficient time to contact professors and TAâ€™s for assistance if needed.

## Meetings

- Members will meet on Tuesdays during allocated lab time for project work. We will allocate this time for discussing the milestone and delegating tasks.
- Members will meet again on Friday via zoom to finalize the project before submission, and/or any other day(s) as agreed upon. If any member is unable to make it for the meeting, written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options and he/she shall follow up with required responsibilities from the meeting from other members.
- Members agree to commit at least  1-2 hours for meetings per week for discussion on project progress.

## Communication

- All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack, Zoom, Github or the team googledoc.
- Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work.
- Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.
- Zoom will be the backup for Slack, and the team googledoc will contain all of the expected deadlines for the week.

## Reviews

- All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. The Proof-Reader is responsible for reviewing all of the Pull Requests each week, in a timely manner as they are submitted.

## Deadlines

- Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during the first meeting of the week. The proof-reader is expected to review the work by the Saturday milestone deadline and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

## Breach of Contract

- Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system, communicated by the Co-leads for the week in which the breach occurs:

1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.

2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract that is required by the member.

3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate

## Submissions

- Milestone 1: Arlin
- Milestone 2: Gloria
- Milestone 3: Victor
- Milestone 4: TBD
