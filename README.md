# Safe Vancity Dashboard
A Vancouver crime rate dashboard. We are your friendly, neighbourhood data scientists wanting to help you make the safest choice of location for your next forever or rental homes!
## Overview

The Safe Vancity dashboard is an interactive platform that provides an overview of the crime rates across various Vancouver neighburhoods, based on 2021 crime statistics data. This dashboard aims to help people make decisions when considering their next trip or move to Vancouver, BC, via visually exploring a dataset of crime statistics. The dashboard also provides summaries of important metrics related to crime statistics and allows useres to filter information by geological location, crime type, crime rate, and time of the crime. 

For details on motivation for creating the dashboard, dataset information and other descriptions, check our the full proposal [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/safe_vancity/blob/main/reports/proposal.md).

## Dashboard description and design

The Safe Vancity app is a dashboard that visualizes the crime rates in Vancouver in 2021. The landing page contains two panels. For the map on the left panel, from the dropdown lists, users can specify the date range (e.g. from 2021.01 to 2021.03), weekdays (M-F), time range (from 8 am to 12 pm) and the crime types (e.g. homicide) that they are interested in, and the map will display the locations where individual crime cases happened. The right-hand-side panel is divided into two sections. In the top section, users get to choose the crime category (i.e. “Violent crimes” or “Property crimes”) and neighborhoods (all or specific ones) from drop-down menu to obtain the distribution of crimes types. Meanwhile, the “Top 3 Crimes” section allows users to see the actual number of crime cases for the top 3 crime types in the selected neighborhood.
